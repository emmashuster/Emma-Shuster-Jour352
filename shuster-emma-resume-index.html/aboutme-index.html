	<p class="summary">Hi! My name is Emma Shuster, and I am an aspiring sports journalist. </p>

<p class="summary">My love for writing sparked as a little girl. I would constantly write short stories, usually thinking that I would write the next best-selling novel. As I grew up and took more English courses, my love for writing only dramatically increased.</p>
 
<p class="summary">In high school, I took a journalism course and soon joined the school newspaper. I loved the idea of storytelling and strongly believed there are always stories to tell- you just have to look for them. </p>
 
<p class="summary">When I got to college, I realized that sports journalism would combine two of my absolute favorite things- writing and sports. I grew up loving all things D.C. sports- especially the Washington Capitals. I believe that sports journalism has the power to unite so many people- regardless of where a person may be from or their political affiliations. I want to help bring those stories to life.</p>
 
<p class="summary">I am a senior at the University of Maryland, College Park, and I will graduate in the spring of 2022 with a Bachelor's Degree in Multi-platform Journalism. To obtain this goal, I am involved with two different campus publications. I am both the Assistant Managing Editor and a staff writer for Her Campus Magazine, where I cover various campus and community issues. I am also a staff writer for Testudo Times, where I cover general sports stories. I am also a student reporter for Capitals Outsider. I interned with Montgomery Community Media in the summer of 2020, covering local Montgomery County news. I interned for PressBox online for the summer of 2021, covering all things Baltimore sports. </p>
